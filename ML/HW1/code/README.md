# ML HW1 — Code

This folder contains the code and helper files for the Machine Learning HW1 assignment. The purpose of this README is to provide a concise explanation of the project, how to run experiments, and the expected folder layout to help reviewers reproduce the results.

## Goals

- Summarize the scripts used in this homework, the train/eval workflow, and dependencies.
- Provide a quick-start guide (create virtual environment, install dependencies, run training/inference).

## Expected folder structure

- `data/` — Raw or preprocessed data (large raw datasets are usually not kept in the repo).
- `models/` — Trained model checkpoints or exported model files.
- `scripts/` or `src/` — Source code (training, evaluation, data preprocessing, etc.).
- `config/` — Experiment configuration files (YAML/JSON).
- `requirements.txt` — Python package requirements.
- `README.md` — This file with quick-start instructions.

The actual filenames may vary for this assignment; please inspect the folder to confirm.

## Quick start (example)

The steps below assume you are on Linux/macOS and have Python 3.8+ installed.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies (if `requirements.txt` exists)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run training (example)

```bash
python train.py --config config/train.yaml
```

4. Run evaluation / inference (example)

```bash
python eval.py --model models/best.pt --data data/val
```

Note: If `train.py`/`eval.py` are not present, replace the command with the actual script names in this folder.

## Common arguments (example)

- `--config`: Path to an experiment configuration file (e.g. learning rate, batch size, number of epochs).
- `--data`: Path to dataset or data folder.
- `--model`: Path to a model checkpoint to load/save.

Most scripts support `--help` for detailed usage, e.g. `python train.py --help`.

## Dependencies

- It's recommended to use a virtual environment. If `requirements.txt` exists, install from it.
- Common packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and a deep learning framework like `torch` or `tensorflow` depending on assignment requirements.

## Files (example)

- `train.py` — Main training script.
- `eval.py` — Evaluation/inference script.
- `utils.py` — Shared utilities (data loading, metrics, etc.).
- `requirements.txt` — Python package list.

If you want me to automatically update this README to reflect the actual filenames in this folder (for example, list all scripts and create exact run commands), I can scan the directory and update the README accordingly. Tell me to "scan and update README" to proceed.

## License

This homework code is provided for educational and grading purposes only. If you want to add a specific license, place a `LICENSE` file here or add license text.

## Notes / Contact

If you want me to add a `run.sh` script, a `requirements.txt` generated from the environment, or more detailed example commands, tell me what to include and I will generate and verify them.
