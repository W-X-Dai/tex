        \item I decided to use Proportion of Variance (PoV) with thresh = 0.95 to determine the number of principal components to keep. With this threshold, I found that each fold selected 7 principal components to retain at least 95\% of the variance in the data. This my cause by the characteristics of loocv, where each training fold is very similar to the overall dataset, leading to consistent PCA results across folds. The execution log for PCA in each fold is provided in Appendix \ref{app:pca_log}.
        \item The overall performance of Bayesian classification with PCA (thresh=0.95) using LOOCV is summarized in Table \ref{tab:loocv_pca_095_performance} below, and the confusion matrix is shown in Table \ref{tab:loocv_pca_095_confusion}. Fig.~\ref{fig:loocv_pca_095_roc_curve} presents the ROC curve for this configuration.

            \label{fig:loocv_pca_095_roc_curve}
        \end{figure}

        With the execution results above, we can see that applying PCA with a variance retention threshold of 95\% leads to a robust classification performance. The AUC of 0.9256 indicates a strong ability to distinguish between the positive and negative classes. The accuracy of 88.35\% further supports the effectiveness of this approach in the given dataset.

        However, the limited amount of data may lead to overfitting. This high performance might not generalize well to unseen data. Although this method performs well on the current dataset under LOOCV evaluation, it still needs further validation on larger and more diverse datasets to confirm its robustness and generalizability.
