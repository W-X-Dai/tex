\section{Classification Tasks}

\subsection{Overall Description}
In this homework, I implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimesionality. I use the Proportion of Variance (PoV) with the threshold of 0.95 to select the number of principal components. After that, I implemented three classification methods: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Logistic Discrimination Function (LDF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the data.

The code of this homework was modified from my previous homeworks (HW1 and HW2), and is organized into three main files: \texttt{ann.py}, \texttt{ldf.py}, and \texttt{svm.py}, each corresponding to one of the classification methods. Please read README.md before running the code.

\subsection{Artificial Neural Networks}
As LDF can be considered as a single-layer neuron network (i.e. no hidden layers), thus I decided to finish the ANN part first. 

The ANN was implemented from scratch in C++, including the forward propagation, backpropagation, and parameter updates (using simple SGD), without relying on high-level deep learning libraries. This simple AN consists three types of layers: linear layer, sigmoid activation layer, and relu activation layer. User can flexibly stack these layers to form a neural network of any architecture.

\subsubsection{Model Description}
The input layer of the ANN has the same number of neurons as the number of principal components after PCA. Then, I experimented with different architectures and finally decided to use two hidden layers with 10 and 5 neurons respectively, both using ReLU activation function. The output layer has a single neuron with sigmoid activation function to output the probability of the positive class. The learning rate was set to 0.005 due to the small dataset size and to ensure stable convergence.


To decided the training epochs, I implemented early stopping mechanism based on validation loss. The training process will stop if the validation loss does not improve for 10 consecutive epochs. The definition of "improve" here is that the validation loss decreases by at least 0.001 compared to the previous best validation loss. To avoid early stopping too early due to random fluctuations in validation loss, I set a minimum number of epochs (15 epochs) before early stopping can take effect, i.e., the training will run for at least 15 epochs regardless of validation loss. I set the maximum number of epochs to 1000 to prevent excessively long training times in case the early stopping condition is never met, but in practice, the training usually stops well before reaching this limit.

\subsubsection{Results}
The overall performance of ANN is shown in the table ~\ref{tab:ann_performance}, and the ROC curve is shown in the figure ~\ref{fig:ann_roc}. The training log is included in the appendix ~\ref{lab:ann_log}.

\subsection{Logistic Discrimination}

\subsubsection{Model Description}
The Logistic Discrimination Function (LDF) was implemented as a simple ANN with 0 hidden layers and 1 input layer. The input layer has the same number of neurons as the number of principal components after PCA. The output layer has a single neuron with sigmoid activation function to output the probability of the positive class. The learning rate was set to 0.005.

The early stopping mechanism is the same as that of ANN, with a minimum of 15 epochs, patience of 10 epochs, and a maximum of 1000 epochs.
\subsubsection{Results}
The overall performance of LDF is shown in the table ~\ref{tab:ldf_performance}, and the ROC curve is shown in the figure ~\ref{fig:ldf_roc}. The training log is included in the appendix ~\ref{lab:ldf_log}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Support Vector Machines}

\subsubsection{Model Description}
In this homework, a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel was implemented from scratch in Python.
The training procedure is based on the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm, which optimizes the dual formulation of the SVM objective function.
The regularization parameter 
$C$ was set to 1.0, and the kernel parameter 
$\gamma$ was set to 0.05 based on preliminary experiments with different parameter values.

During training, the RBF kernel matrix of the training set was precomputed to improve computational efficiency.
The algorithm iteratively scans the training samples and identifies those that violate the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions based on their prediction errors.
For each violating sample, a second sample is selected, and the corresponding pair of Lagrange multipliers is updated according to the SMO update rules while respecting the box constraints.
The bias term is updated after each pairwise optimization step to ensure consistency of the decision function.

After training, the learned dual parameters are used to compute raw decision scores for both training and test data.
Model performance is evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which is computed from the decision scores without probability calibration.

\subsubsection{Results}
The overall performance of SVM is shown in the table ~\ref{tab:svm_performance}, and the ROC curve is shown in the figure ~\ref{fig:svm_roc}. The training log is included in the appendix ~\ref{lab:svm_log}.

        Specificity & 0.9516 (59/62) \\
        Test AUC & 0.8666 \\
        Train AUC & 0.9992 \\

\end{figure}

\subsection{SVM with Sklearn}

However, there are several limitations in the custom SVM implementation.
The adopted SMO algorithm is a simplified version and does not incorporate advanced heuristics for selecting the second working variable or accelerating convergence.
In addition, the number of outer iterations is fixed to 100, rather than being determined by convergence criteria based on optimality conditions.
As a result, the obtained solution may be suboptimal compared to mature SVM solvers.

Implementing a fully optimized SVM solver from scratch is nontrivial and difficult to accomplish within the limited time.
Therefore, an additional SVM implementation based on the scikit-learn library was included as a reference baseline.
The implementation of this library-based SVM was assisted by ChatGPT.

The performance of the scikit-learn SVM is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:svm_sklearn_performance}, and the corresponding ROC curve is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:svm_sklearn_roc}.
As expected, the library-based implementation achieves better performance than the handcrafted SVM implementation.

\section{Methods comparison}

Table~\ref{tab:model_comparison} is an overall comparison of the models implemented across the three homeworks: Bayesian Classifier(BC) with forward selection(FS) from HW1, BC with PCA from HW2, and the three models from this homework: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Logistic Discrimination Function (LDF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Among all evaluated models, the artificial neural network (ANN) achieved the
best overall performance, with the highest test AUC (0.9327) and a balanced
trade-off between sensitivity (0.8293) and specificity (0.8710). This may be attributed to its flexibility in modeling complex, non-linear decision boundaries. This my cause it overfitting, but also endowed it with great potential. With proper regularization and hyperparameter tuning, ANN can generalize well to unseen data.

The linear discriminant function (LDF) and the SVM implemented using scikit-learn
exhibited comparable discriminative ability, with test AUC values close to that
of ANN. LDF favored higher specificity at the expense of sensitivity, whereas
the scikit-learn SVM provided a more balanced classification behavior. In
contrast, the handcrafted SVM performed the worst, due to its simplified
implementation and suboptimal hyperparameter choices.

For the Bayesian classifier, both feature selection (FS) and principal component
analysis (PCA) led to comparable classification performance, with similar test
AUC values.

In contrast, PCA achieved a more balanced performance, with higher specificity
and overall accuracy while maintaining comparable sensitivity. By projecting the
original features into a lower-dimensional orthogonal subspace, PCA effectively
reduced feature redundancy and noise, which may explain its improved stability
and generalization compared to direct feature selection. These results suggest
that PCA provides a more robust feature representation for the Bayesian classifier
in this dataset.

The worst AUC in these models (handcrafted SVM) is still 0.8666, which indicates that the dataset is not robustly separable. Thus I can't draw a definitive conclusion about which model is the best.
